Voting+ improves the voting experience.

### Exposed Archivements (Deprecated)
_Also known as "Visible Archivements"_

Exposed Archivements exposes the earning conditions for Flavortown archivements.

### Sidebar+ 
_Also know as "Better Sidebar"_

Sidebar+ adds:
- the abbility to pin the sidebar making it visible in every page.
- hotkey support navigate with ctrl + 1-6.
- the abbility to modify the side bar to your liking by changing the order and even hiding pages.

### Settings+

_Also known as "Spicetown Settings"_

Settings+ adds "Screenshare Mode" ([concept discussion](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C09MPB8NE8H/p1766001569993999)), which hides most sensitive elements (see [issue #3](https://github.com/SabioOfficial/spicetown/issues/3)). It replaces blur, which is known to be unsafe. More settings are in the works and will be released soon.

| Setting | Released | Maintained | Issues |

#### Implementing Themes

To implement themes, open the `content.css` file in `/scripts`. You will find `[data-theme="bg-color-ruby"]` along with other themes. Add a new theme by creating a new data theme, for example: `[data-theme="bg-color-log"]`. Use existing themes as a template for the CSS variables you need. You also need to add a new `themes__div-option` to the themes page in `addThemesPage()` in `content.js`.

#### Ruby

Ruby is the first custom theme of Spicetown (and probably Flavortown as a whole). It is in heavy development. You can enable the Ruby theme via the Themes page (inaccessible to non-Spicetown users). It consists of mostly dark-ish red.

#### Leafy 

Leafy is the opposite to Ruby consisting of dark green forest like colors

#### **Catppuccin**

**Catppuccin** is the most requested theme family for **Spicetown**. The first Catppuccin theme was released (in-dev) on **21/12/25**. This is also the first theme family for **Spicetown**.

##### Catppuccin Mocha

**Catppuccin Mocha** is the first Catppuccin theme to be added. It is the second theme added to **Spicetown** after Ruby. It uses a lavender-based design.

##### Catppuccin Macchiato

**Catppuccin Macchiato** is the second Catppuccin theme to be added. It is the third theme added to **Spicetown** after Catppuccin Mocha. Because of Neon, one of the Flavortown dev requests, this theme uses a mauve design. This theme is a work in progress.

#### Charcoal

**Charcoal** is the fourth theme added to **Spicetown** after Catppuccin Macchiato (made by Aperaine). Originally the theme would have everything on fire, but it looked too much like a Halloween theme. Until more projects ship so I can test voting CSS, this is a work in progress.

#### Midnight

**Midnight** (made by Joko26) is designed to be a dark-mode theme inspired by the dark and cozy feel of Dracula themes.
